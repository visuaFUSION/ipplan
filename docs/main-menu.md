# Welcome to IPplan

IPplan is a free (GPL), web-based, multilingual IP address management and tracking tool originally created by Richard Ellerbrock in 2001. Written in PHP, it simplifies the administration of your IP address space.

IPplan goes beyond basic IP address management to include DNS administration, configuration file management, circuit management, and hardware inventory tracking, all customizable via templates. It supports single networks or multiple customers with overlapping address space.
