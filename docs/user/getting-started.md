# Quick Start Guide

This guide covers the basics of using IPplan for IP address management.

## Logging In

1. Navigate to your IPplan URL (provided by your administrator)
2. Enter your username and password
3. Click Login

Your session will remain active until you log out or it times out.

## Understanding the Interface

### Menu Navigation

The menu bar at the top provides access to all features:

| Menu | Purpose |

| Network | IP and subnet management |
| DNS | DNS records (if enabled) |
| Options | Your personal settings |
| Help | Documentation |

IPplan organizes IP addresses by "customer." Depending on your permissions, you may see:
- A single customer (your organization)
- Multiple customers you can manage
- All customers (if you're an administrator)
